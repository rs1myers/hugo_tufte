It&rsquo;s an early-stage hodgepodge of ideas that strike me as fitting together in a view of the world that accommodates some of the major things that we know (or should know) to be true about the world, in particular the immense range of consciousness exhibited by (at least some) humans and, my mild obsession with cetacean intelligence. that accommodates a broad range of what we have reason to believe is true.</p><p>The goal here is not to argue for a specific worldview or narrative, but rather in a small way to help open up the conceptual space<label for=sidenote-2 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(2)</label>

<span class=sidenote><span class=sidenote-number>(4)</span>It seems safe to exclude <a href=https://www.spaghettimonster.org/>Pastafarianism</a> in serious discussions about spirituality. But the idea that religions are a form of mental illness should be seen as equally absurd, as claimed by Sam Harris in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Faith><em>The End of Faith</em></a>.</span></p><h2 id=edward-tufte-style>Edward Tufte style
<a href=#edward-tufte-style class=heading-anchor>#</a></h2><p>The site was built with a <a href=https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte>Hugo theme</a> based on Edward Tufte&rsquo;s ideas, and the very strong tutelage of ChatGPT (no way I could have done this on my own). The Tufte <a href=https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/>CSS package</a> was developed by <a href=https://www.daveliepmann.com/>Dave Liepman</a> &ldquo;to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte&rsquo;s books and handouts.&rdquo; Tufte is revered by many for his simple, e legant approach to presenting information, particularly data visualization. Many of his books, all self-published,<label for=sidenote-5 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(5)</label>

are widely considered classics by technical editors and professionals whose job includes communicating technical information. Tufte has a particularly low regard for Power Point presentations: his 2003 eBook <a href=https://www.edwardtufte.com/book/the-cognitive-style-of-powerpoint-pitching-out-corrupts-within-ebook/><em>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within</em></a> argues that Power Point presentations may have significantly contributed to the Columbia shuttle disaster through
jargon-heavy, carelessly structured bullet points by Boeing engineers in presentations about the potential for foam debris to have damaged the shuttle&rsquo;s wing.</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="https://rs1myers.github.io/hugo_tufte/contact/?ref=footer">« contact</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right></div><ul class=page-footer-menu></ul></footer></section><section><nav class=menu><ul></ul></nav></section></article></main></body></html>
